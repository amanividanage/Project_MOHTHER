Overview
This is our second-year group project, MOHTHER-  A web based application that streamlines the Maternal and child clinic System in Sri Lanka. 

Healthcare is of great importance for a nation's growth and development. In the specific context of Sri Lanka, the government serves as the primary provider of healthcare services to the public. 

An in-depth examination of the current clinic system revealed several pressing issues and to address these issues, we have introduced "MOHTHER," a web-based application that has transformed our vision into reality. 



Challenges Addressed by MOHTHER:

1. Long Queues and Waiting Times: MOHTHER streamlines the appointment process, reducing wait times.

2. Data Redundancy and Time Wastage: It eliminates redundant paperwork, optimizing data management.

3. Data Security and Accessibility: MOHTHER ensures the security and easy accessibility of critical healthcare information.

4. Inefficiencies and Favouritism: The application promotes fair and efficient healthcare delivery, eliminating bias.

5. Manual Charting: MOHTHER automates the charting process for increased accuracy and efficiency.



What MOHTHER Offers:

- Unified Data Access

- Appointment Reservations

- SMS Notifications for Reminders
