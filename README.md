# Overview

This is our second-year group project, **"MOHTHER- A web based application that streamlines the Maternal and child clinic System in Sri Lanka"**. 

Healthcare is of great importance for a nation's growth and development. In the specific context of Sri Lanka, the government serves as the primary provider of healthcare services to the public. 

An in-depth examination of the current clinic system revealed several pressing issues and to address these issues, we have introduced "MOHTHER," a web-based application that has transformed our vision into reality.
